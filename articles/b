# Bot programming

This is one of the first things I discovered outside from school. I never had this many fun in any video game.

On the [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/) website, they organize 11 days bot programming contests, with thousands of participants, twice a year. I started in Fall 2020, and try to never miss any.
