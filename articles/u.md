# Unix üñ•Ô∏è

... I am only working on Unix environments: MacOS and Linux.

I tried a lot of Linux Distrubutions:
 - Fedora
 - Debian
 - Kali
 - \[K-L-X\]Ubuntu (my first one)
 - Pop! OS
 - Manjaro (my favorite)
 - Arch Linux, ...

I cannot imagining myself working on a Windows computer. Ever. Sorry Bill...
