# Winning

I am very competitive.

The first time I felt the thrill of it was at 13 yo, at the [OMB](http://omb.sbpm.be/) (Belian Mathematics Olympiads). I realized that I was really good at it. Each consecutive year in High School, I managed to qualify myself for the finals.

After that, I couldn't find this kind of thrill.

8 years after High School, I discovered programming. And subsequentially, all the programming contests !

What I liked:
 - [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/) Bot Programming Contests
 - [Google Jam](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam)
 - Cyber Security Challenges ([CSCBE](cybersecuritychallenge.be))
 - Machine Learning Contests
