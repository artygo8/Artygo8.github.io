# Music ðŸŽµ

... I have been playing the guitar since I was 10, then I started playing the piano at 12. I never got really good at it, but I really enjoy playing.

After obtaining my BA in geology (**g**), I decided to study sound engineering at the IAD (Institut des Arts de Diffusion) in Louvain-la-Neuve.

I made it through the first year.

I hated it.

I got disgusted by music and I stopped playing for a while.

A big question mark appeared in my life, but a different kind of school opened in Brussels, and I decided to give it a try (press **n**).
