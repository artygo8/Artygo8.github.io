# Algorithm

Probably the thing I love the most about programming. 

---

I started writing some simple ones aiming for the most *pythonic* way.
(link: [github.com/Artygo8/PrettyPython3Algorithms](https://github.com/Artygo8/PrettyPython3Algorithms))

Here is an example of a very simple sorting algorithm.


```python
def bubbleSort(lst):
    for n in range(len(lst), 1, -1):
        for i in range(n-1):
            is_ordered = lst[i] < lst[i + 1]
            if not is_ordered:
                lst[i], lst[i + 1] = lst[i + 1], lst[i]
    return lst
```


When writing code, I try to:
 - keep it clean,
 - use appropriate variable/function names,
 - avoid `#commenting`,
 - keep it simple stupid (`KISS`),
 - keep it short.
