# Algorithm

Probably the thing I love the most about programming. 

---

I started writing some simple ones aiming for the most *pythonic* way.
(link: [github.com/Artygo8/PrettyPython3Algorithms](https://github.com/Artygo8/PrettyPython3Algorithms))

Here is an example of a very simple sorting algorithm.


```python
def bubbleSort(lst):
    n = len(lst) - 1
    while n:
        for i in range(n):
            if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
                lst[i], lst[i + 1] = lst[i + 1], lst[i]
        n -= 1
    return lst
```


When writing code, I try to:
 - keep it clean,
 - use appropriate variable/function names,
 - avoid `#commenting`,
 - keep it simple stupid (`KISS`),
 - keep it short.
