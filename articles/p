# Python

My shy introduction to programming was given in college, at the ULB (University of Brussels). We were learning python.

A few years later, I became a C programmer at [42](https://www.s19.be/), and I was lightyears ahead of what I learned at the University.

I decided then to give it another try.
A few months later, I landed a job as a Software Engineer at [Odoo](https://www.odoo.com/) a very competitive employer in Belgium.

```python
# Hello World in Python3
print('Hello World!')
```
