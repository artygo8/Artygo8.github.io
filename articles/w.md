# Winning ‚≠ê

... I am highly competitive.

The first time I experienced the thrill of competition was at the age of 13 during the [Belian Mathematics Olympiads (OMB)](http://omb.sbpm.be/). It was then that I realized my proficiency in the subject, consistently qualifying for the finals throughout my High School years.

However, after graduation, I struggled to find a similar source of excitement. It wasn't until 8 years later that I stumbled upon programming, and subsequently, various programming contests.

Some of my favorite contests include:
- [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/) Bot Programming Contests
- [Google Jam](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam)
- Cyber Security Challenges ([CSCBE](cybersecuritychallenge.be))
- Machine Learning Contests
