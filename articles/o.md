... First job I landed after studying for 1.5 years at School 19 (press **n** for more details).

I joined without any experience or internships, but school felt like a full-time internship, helping me catch up quickly.

I started as a support engineer but didn't like it, so I switched to the R&D team.

The CTO saw my motivation and let me work independently on projects.

First, I updated API connectors with the Stock & Inventory team, handling DHL, UPS, FedEx, and EasyPost connectors. I also simplified modules by combining similar logic.

Then came a big project - building the first Python-based PEPPOL Access Point and Service Metadata Publisher. It was tough, learning the PEPPOL protocol (AS4) and creating a connector for invoicing. Thanks to Antony for the opportunity.

Finally, I joined the IAP team, improving OCR with a great developer.
