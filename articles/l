# Low level

I learned programming at school [19](https://www.s19.be/) in Brussels.

We were tought programming, only by `doing` - building - discovering on our owns. And to `do`, we had to use C for the main part of the cursus. We also learned Assembly and C++.

For this reason, I keep a special part in my heart for low level programming.

```c
/* Hello World in C */

#include <unistd.h>

int main()
{
   write(1, "Hello World!\n", 13);
   return 0;
}
```
