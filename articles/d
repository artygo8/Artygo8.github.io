# Docker

Docker is a great tool for running applications in a neutral environment.

Eventhough I would not consider myself as a DevOps Engineer, I had my fun with it along with Kubernetes and Grafana.

At first I did not understand anything, and to stay focus, I decided to focus on my **bash scripting** skills.
