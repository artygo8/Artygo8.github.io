# Elm

This is the Programming Language used for this website.

[Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) is a language designed for web applications.

I started using Elm as an introduction to **functional programming language**, and I LOVE it.

At first, it felt weird because I am used to *OOP* (object oriented programming) - but once you get it, it is so easy to implement anything.

It makes me wonder why people are still using *JavaScript* Frameworks. ðŸ˜‚
