... From May 2023 to Present, I'm working as a Senior Python Programmer at [Zensor](https://www.zensor.be/).

Zensor is a scale-up that aims to make the world a better place by making it more sustainable.

I am working on the data pipeline, which is the core of the product.

Basically, I am making sure that the data is collected, stored, and processed correctly.
